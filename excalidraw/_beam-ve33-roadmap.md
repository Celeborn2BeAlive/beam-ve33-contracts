**Minimal contract set to deploy:**
- Core emission & lock protocol:
  - EmissionToken (BEAM)
  - VotingEscrow (veBEAM)
  - Rebase veBEAM (RewardsDistributor)
  - Minter
- Voting:
  - Epoch Distributor (fork & adapt Thena V3)
  - Voter (fork & adapt Thena V3)
- Voters rewarding:
  - Gauge Factory (fork & adapt Thena V3)
  - Algebra Vault (fork & adapt Thena V3)
  - Voting Incentive (fork & adapt Thena V3)
  - Voting Incentive Factory (fork & adapt Thena V3)
- Farming:
  - Incentive Maker (fork & adapt Thena V3)
  - Gauge Algebra Eternal Farming (fork & adapt Thena V3)
- UniV2 DEX (optional, can be added after)
  - Router V2
  - Classic PairFactory

**Dev roadmap**:
- DONE:
  - Migrate Retro as EmissionToken to new codebase
  - Migrate VotingEscrow to new codebase
  - Write Beam ignition deployment script
- TODO:
  - Re-read VotingEscrow code and document it
  - Migrate Minter to new codebase
    - Re-read code and document it
    - Make some adaptation, for example rename "voter" => "epochDistributor"
  - Migrate "Rebase veBEAM" (RewardsDistributor) contract
    - Re-read code and document it
  - Thena V3 forking for CL farming
    - Read Epoch Distributor and document it
    - Read Voter and document it
      - Ensure we can integrate new gauge systems for future extension of the DEX
    - Read Incentive Maker and document it
      - Check that it can be used for our version of Algebra
      - If not, adapt the contract
    - Read Gauge Algebra Eternal Farming and document it
    - Read Algebra Vault and document it
    - Read Gauge Factory and document it
    - Adapt and migrate all code to our codebase
  - Finish deployment script and try it onchain
    - Try to run the protocol at high frequency (one epoch = 1 minute)
- NEXT TODO
  - Include Algebra fees to AlgebraVault
    - Check with Chase if we also have some treasuryShare ?

**Questions / Investigations**:
- Should we centralize role management to `PermissionsRegistry` or have roles defined at each contract ?
  - Thena V3 contracts seems to have roles defined at each contract
- For upgradable contracts, check how to deploy & admin them with hardhat ignition
  - Avoid upgradable ?
