**Dev Log**

- 2025-08-08
  - DONE:
    - Investigated how to run automated tests on hardhat and localhost networks + use of ignition to deploy
    - Implemented simple tests for BeamToken contract
- 2025-08-05
  - DONE:
    - From Retro:
      - Migrated Minter contracts
        - Updated to rename `voter` to `epochDistributor`
      - Migrated "Rebase veBEAM" (RewardsDistributorV2) contract
      - Migrated "Solidy UniV2" DEX contracts (PairFactory, Pair, PairFees, RouterV2)
        - *NOTE*: Probably won't be used for Beam, but if we need they are ready.
          - They're quite limited though (same fee tier for all pairs)
          - Would be better to fork another adaptation (Velodrome or Ramses)
    - Forked from Thena V3
      - EpochDistributorUpgradeable (from EpochDistributorBSC)
        - Removed crosschain distribution
        - Adapted variable names, removed references to THE and BNB
        - This contract received liquid emission tokens from the Minter and distribute them to gauges at each epoch
      - VotingIncentives
        - This contract replace bribe contracts from Retro / Thena V2, with cleaner code
      - VotingIncentivesFactory
        - Used to deploy VotingIncentives for each pool
      - Voter
        - This new Voter only handles vote allocation while reward distribution is handled by EpochDistributor
      - Gauge
        - This is the staking contract for UniV2 LP tokens and ALM tokens
        - Probably won't be used for Beam, but if we need they are ready.
        - Each Gauge has a VotingIncentive
      - FeeVault
        - Aggregate swap fees for legacy pools, so gauge can claim them and distribute to VotingIncentive contracts
      - GaugeFactory
        - Used by GlobalFactory to deploy gauge contracts
      - GlobalFactory
        - Used to deploy gauges and track whitelisted tokens
      - Algebra farming and voting incentives distribution:
        - AlgebraVault
          - This contract should be instanciated for each Algebra pool and set as communityVault of that pool
          - The GaugeEternalFarming claims aggregated swap fees from it to route them to VotingIncentive
        - AlgebraVaultFactory
          - This contract is used to create AlgebraVault
          - It should be set as the `vaultFactory` of the AlgebraFactory
          - Current limitation for us is that we cannot create new vault for existing pools => needs adaptation
        - GaugeEternalFarming
          - Manage swap fee claiming from AlgebraVault and route them to VotingIncentive
          - Managed distribution of farming rewards to Algebra Farming Center using IncentiveMaker
        - IncentiveMakerUpgradeable
          - Manage creation & management of farming campaign on the Algebra Farming Center
    - Deployment
      - Iterated on hardhat ignition modules to deploy everything
  - TODO:
    - Rename RewardsDistributorV2 to RebaseDistributor for clarity
      - In Minter rename state variable to match
    - Adapt AlgebraVaultFactory so we can create AlgebraVault for already deployed CL pool
    - Adapt remaining Thena V3 contracts to remove theNFT related stuff, BNB stuff, etc.
    - Deployment: handle setup script to connect all contracts together
    - Test farming & reward distribution in prod with a fake Beam token
      - Think about a way to easily test the required parts without the epoch system
    - Include Algebra fees to AlgebraVault
      - Check with Chase if we also have some treasuryShare ?
    - Adapt IncentiveMaker => rename thena to emissionToken, and wbnb to wrappedGasToken
    - Rename ignition contract proxy with Proxy at the end for clarity

- 2025-08-03
  - DONE:
    - Migrate Retro as EmissionToken to new codebase
    - Migrate VotingEscrow to new codebase
    - Write Beam ignition deployment script
  - TODO:
    - Re-read VotingEscrow code and document it
    - Migrate Minter to new codebase
      - Re-read code and document it
      - Make some adaptation, for example rename "voter" => "epochDistributor"
    - Migrate "Rebase veBEAM" (RewardsDistributor) contract
      - Re-read code and document it
    - Thena V3 forking for CL farming
      - Read Epoch Distributor and document it
      - Read Voter and document it
        - Ensure we can integrate new gauge systems for future extension of the DEX
      - Read Incentive Maker and document it
        - Check that it can be used for our version of Algebra
        - If not, adapt the contract
      - Read Gauge Algebra Eternal Farming and document it
      - Read Algebra Vault and document it
      - Read Gauge Factory and document it
      - Adapt and migrate all code to our codebase
    - Finish deployment script and try it onchain
      - Try to run the protocol at high frequency (one epoch = 1 minute)
